    // How to escape:
    //
    // - Absolute URLs ("scheme:...")
    //
    //   As described in RFC3986 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.2), we can prepend "./" to escape the
    //   possible scheme while keeping the path relative: "http://example/" -> "./http://example/".
    //
    // - Protocol-relative URLs ("//newhost/...")
    //
    //   For the latter, we can escape the path while maintaining its absolute-ness by prepending a "/.",
    //   in a similar fashion to the path sigil: "//notahost" -> "/.//notahost".
    //
    // Q: How will the parser interpret this?
    // A: The presence of the "./" or "/." prefixes will ensure the input always reaches the path/file path states.
    //
    // Q: Does this change the meaning of the operation?
    // A: If the input starts with a "?" or "#" (so it doesn't touch the path), it wouldn't have gone down the path/file path
    //    states, so we shouldn't touch it.
    //
    //    Additionally, we need to make sure that we maintain whether the path part of the input is absolute or relative
    //    (whether it starts with a "/" or not).
    //
    //    The "." components we add to the path are entirely skipped by the path parser; they do not even affect ".." popcounts.
    //    However, their presence means that a previously-empty string would no longer be empty (which can be significant),
    //    and it hinders the quirk that relative paths whose first component is a Windows drive are treated as absolute.
    //    Therefore, we have to detect empty inputs (which we can send through unescaped), and relative paths
    //    which start with Windows drive letters (which have to be escaped as "file:C:..." so the drive letter is still at
    //    the start of the path) as special cases.
